## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant purple (#9D4EDD) for a modern, cutting-edge feel.
- Background color: Light grey (#E9ECEF), a desaturated tint of the primary color to ensure good contrast in a light scheme.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#577590), an analogous color that stands out and draws the eye.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines to create a geometric, fashionable look and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body to ensure readability.
- Use clean, modern icons to represent different features and options. Icons should be consistent in style and easily recognizable.
- Employ a card-based layout for the character builder steps, ensuring each section is clearly defined and easy to navigate on mobile devices.
- Use subtle animations and transitions to provide visual feedback and enhance user experience when adjusting character features or generating content.
